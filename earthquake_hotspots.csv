It was designed by Albert C. Schweinfurth, who made unconventional use of Shingle Style architecture, usually applied to homes, in designing a church. It was also highly unusual for a church building in several other ways, including the use of industrial-style metal sash windows, sections of redwood tree trunks as pillars, the strong horizontal emphasis, and a semicircular apse with a conical roof.

The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the California State Historic Resources Survey, and is a City of Berkeley Landmark. It has also been known as University Dance Studio and Bancroft Dance Studio for its current use.Although originally outside the university grounds, it is now the second oldest building still standing on the Berkeley campus. At the time it was built, facing a block of Dana Street that no longer exists, it joined a cluster of Protestant churches that had been built since the 1870s with the encouragement of the university administration. The land was acquired by the university in 1960 through eminent domain for the construction of a student union complex.The church was the first meeting place of the Hillside Club, formed in 1898 to promote Arts and Crafts movement principles in the growing university town.When it was built, A. C. Schweinfurth, the architect, was well on his way to an eminent career with the patronage of the Hearst family, but this church ended up being his last project. While it was under construction, he began a two-year European tour with his wife and daughter. He came down with typhoid fever and died in September 1900.In 1908 the congregation built an adjacent building called Unity Hall, designed by member Bernard Maybeck, which was demolished in 1965 for the construction of Zellerbach Hall. The Schweinfurth-designed building was preserved, landmarked, and restored with seismic upgrades and new shingles in 1999."

29,"Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California","The Claremont district is a neighborhood straddling the city limits of Oakland and Berkeley in the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay Area in California, United States.  The main thoroughfares are Claremont and Ashby Avenues.
The name ""Claremont"" was adopted December 20, 1879 at a meeting convened by a real estate developer and local resident, Grant Taggert. Within a year or so of this, the name of the main thoroughfare was changed from Telegraph Road to Claremont Avenue.  The Telegraph Road had been named for the first telegraph line into Oakland, strung by the Alta Telegraph Company in 1859.  The line ran from Martinez across the hills and down what was then named ""Harwood's Canyon"" after an early claimant to grazing lands in the canyon above the Claremont neighborhood, retired sea captain and Oakland wharfinger William Harwood.  With the advent of the telegraph line, it became ""Telegraph Canyon"", a name that persists for a side canyon near the summit of the hills.  The creek which runs through the Claremont neighborhood was first known as the north fork of Temescal Creek.  It later became Harwood Creek, and eventually, Claremont Creek.
During the 19th century, a stage coach line ran up the canyon and over the summit into Contra Costa County. This became an early auto route over the Berkeley Hills even after the first tunnel (the InterCounty Tunnel/Kennedy Tunnel) opened up in 1903 to the south of Claremont Canyon, above where the Caldecott Tunnel is today.
In 1905, Duncan McDuffie opened up the Claremont Park development, an upscale tract.
In 1909, the portion of the district which now lies within the City of Oakland was annexed to the city.  Until then, it had been an unincorporated area of Alameda County.
In the early 1900s real estate interests associated with the Key System built the Claremont Hotel at the mouth of Claremont Canyon. The Key System ran one of its commuter train lines directly to the hotel up Claremont Avenue until service ended in 1958. This train became the transbay ""E"" train upon completion of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge.
The principal west-east thoroughfare through the Claremont was at first Russell Street which led directly to the road up Claremont Canyon. With the opening of the first tunnel however, Ashby became the more convenient approach to the Tunnel Road and was improved over the years to channel through traffic, especially during the 1930s when both the new Broadway (later re-named Caldecott) Tunnel and the Bay Bridge were constructed.  Ashby and Tunnel Road were then designated State Route 24 and connected to the Eastshore Highway (now Freeway) to serve as an access route to the Bay Bridge and San Francisco. Upon completion of the Grove-Shafter Freeway in the 1960s, it was re-designated State Route 13 and connected to the new Warren Freeway.
The Claremont district was one of the areas affected by the 1991 Oakland firestorm. The flames came within a few blocks of the Claremont Hotel, destroying much of the area northeast of Tunnel Road.  The area has since been rebuilt.

The venue opened in 1923 and currently seats around 63,000 fans for football. The playing field runs NW-SE, at an elevation of 410 feet (125 m) above sea level. It has been named one of the top college football stadiums by various publications, and it was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on November 27, 2006.Memorial Stadium was funded from public contributions, as a memorial to Californians who lost their lives in World War I (1917–18). The chair of the architectural committee was John Galen Howard, the university's chief architect, and his influence is evident in the stadium's neoclassical motif. In addition to its unique architecture, the stadium's position at the foot of the Berkeley hills provides top row spectators with panoramic views of San Francisco Bay and west side viewers with views of the Berkeley Hills and Strawberry Canyon. This has earned it a reputation as one of the most scenic venues in college football.
Traditionally, during all football games and especially during the Big Game against Stanford, the hill overlooking the eastern side of Memorial Stadium attracts spectators hoping to watch a game for free, earning the nickname ""Tightwad Hill""."

"
36,Harmon Gym (1879),"The original Harmon Gymnasium was a gymnasium on the campus of the University of California in Berkeley, California.  It was the fourth building built on campus, after North Hall, South Hall and Bacon Hall, and the first built with funds from a private donor.  In 1878, Albion Keith Paris Harmon, an Oakland businessman, donated $15,000 ($412 thousand in 2019 dollars) to the University for the construction of a gymnasium and assembly hall, which was to be named in his honor.  In 1879 the octagonal wooden building opened, north of Strawberry Creek.
The building served as a gymnasium, a theater, assembly hall, dance hall and the headquarters of the military cadet corps.  In 1892, it was the site of the first competitive collegiate women's basketball game, between the University's women and Miss Head's School.  By 1900 the needs of the campus had outgrown the gymnasium, so the decision was made to expand the building, by cutting the octagon in half, moving one half and building the new gymnasium between the two halves.  The expanded Harmon Gym held 1,400 by the time the California Golden Bears men's basketball team started competing in 1907.  However, even this expansion proved to not be enough for the growing interest in college basketball.  By 1925 only lesser non-conference games were held in the gym, with conference games and important games being held in the Oakland Civic Auditorium.  In 1931 construction was started on its replacement, the current Haas Pavilion, which would eventually share the same name as its predecessor from 1959 to 1999.  The building was torn down not long after the completion of the new Men's Gymnasium, and in 1950 Dwinelle Hall was built on the site."
37,"Senior Hall (Berkeley, California)","Senior Hall is a historic building on the University of California, Berkeley campus, in Berkeley, California. The rustic log cabin structure was designed by architect John Galen Howard. The building was proposed in 1903 and dedicated in 1906. It was originally used as the university's student union and run by the senior male students. A senior honor society called the Order of the Golden Bear was largely responsible for building the hall, and it held secret meetings at the hall after its construction. According to the Daily Californian, Senior Hall was largely responsible for student self-governance at Berkeley, as the hall gave seniors a place to meet and discuss campus issues. A new student union replaced the hall in 1923, but the Order of the Golden Bear continues to meet there.Senior Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974."
38,Harold E. Jones Child Study Center,"The Harold E. Jones Child Study Center is a research and educational institution for young children at the University of California, Berkeley. It is one of the oldest continuously running centers for the study of children in the country. The Jones Child Study Center has a special relationship with the Institute of Human Development as a site for research, training and outreach to the community, parents, and teachers. The Institute of Human Development's fundamental mission is to study evolutionary, biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors that affect human development from birth through old age. Research conducted at the Institute of Human Development and the Jones Child Study Center is interdisciplinary: psychology, education, social welfare, architecture, sociology, linguistics, public health, and pediatrics. The primary audiences for the findings include scholars and parents. Faculty, postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students observe and test children attending the preschool for their research projects. Undergraduate students in Early Childhood Education may also gain experience in the classrooms as teachers' assistants.The Jones CSC preschool has an outdoor play area that is accessible virtually all day long via sliding doors and partially protected by an overhead canopy. Catherine Landreth, a former director of the school and designer of the building, worked with Joseph Esherick to create a space where the development of children would be highlighted. This included the careful planning of ceiling heights and placement of activity centers. In most other preschools, the ceilings tend to be low which emphasizes the height of adults in relation to children. Esherick and Landreth believed that a higher ceiling would shift the observers' focus from the height differential of the people occupying the space to the activities taking place. The activity centers were constructed to keep the children engaged by placing items at the child's eye level. Landreth wanted a place that did not impose learning but encouraged them to engage in activities that interests the child. The guiding philosophy behind the preschool is that a child's environment can positively affect development.The Jones CSC is also the home to the Greater Good Science Center, which is an interdisciplinary research center concentrating on the scientific understanding of social well-being.

39,Wheeler Hall,"Wheeler Hall is a building on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California in the Classical Revival style.  Home to the English department, it was named for the philologist and university president Benjamin Ide Wheeler.
The building was opened in 1917. It houses the largest lecture hall on the Berkeley campus, Wheeler Auditorium.
On February 29, 1940, UC Berkeley professor Ernest O. Lawrence received the Nobel Prize in Physics in Wheeler Auditorium from Carl Wallerstedt, Consul General from Sweden, due to the danger of crossing the Atlantic during World War II. The building was the site of many of the Free Speech Movement protests in the 1960s and is a focal point of the Berkeley campus. In the 2010s, it has been the place for many university protests and several building takeovers."
40,Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society,"The Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society at UC Berkeley was founded in 2010 through funding by the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund, as  a part of the UC Berkeley Initiative for Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity. Organized into seven research clusters, the Haas Institute involves over 100 researchers and faculty across the University of California system. Eight endowed chairs focused on equity and inclusion form the core of the clusters."
41,South Hall (UC Berkeley),"South Hall is the oldest building on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, and the only remaining building of the original campus. South Hall was originally the counterpart of North Hall, which no longer exists, but was located where the Bancroft Library currently stands.
The first physics laboratory in the United States was hosted in South Hall in 1879. It also has been home to the College of Agriculture, a business school, and a temporary museum for the state geological survey. The University Herbarium was housed in South Hall from 1890 till 1897. It currently houses the UC Berkeley School of Information. When Wheeler Hall was planned, the entrance of South Hall was removed from the west side and added on the east side entrance. The original wooden porch was replaced in 1997 with glass fiber reinforced concrete.
According to legend, the rooftop scene of Mary Poppins was filmed at South Hall, although this has been shown to be false.Campus tour guides often point out a small stone bear, sculpted by Michael H. Casey, in the architecture of South Hall, on the balcony railing above the entrance, in the third circle from the left, claiming it is the smallest bear statue on campus.
The four-story building is located southwest of Sather Tower."

44,Dwinelle Hall,"Dwinelle Hall is the second largest building on the University of California, Berkeley campus. It was completed in 1952, and is named after John W. Dwinelle, who was the State Assemblyman responsible for the ""Organic Act"" that established the University of California in 1868. He was a member of the first Board of Regents. Dwinelle houses the departments of classics, rhetoric, linguistics, history, comparative literature, South and Southeast Asian studies, film studies, French, German, Italian studies, Scandinavian, Slavic languages, Spanish and Portuguese, and gender and women's studies.Although many myths surround the odd construction of the building, Dwinelle Hall was designed by Ernest E. Weihe, Edward L. Frick, and Lawrence A. Kruse, with Eckbo Royston & Williams, landscape artists. Construction was completed in 1953, with expansion completed in 1998. The southern block of Dwinelle Hall contains three levels of classrooms as well as four lecture halls, and the northern block houses seven stories of faculty and department offices. While the northern office block of Dwinelle is often referred to as the ""Dwinelle Annex,"" it should not be confused with the Dwinelle Annex, which is a wooden building located to the west of Dwinelle Hall.The Dwinelle Annex was designed by John Galen Howard and built in 1920. From 1920–33 it was used for Military Science, and from 1933–58 it was used for Music. During these periods of use, it was called the Military Sciences Building and the Music Building. Some remodeling was done in 1933 to accommodate the music department, and in 1949 it was enlarged to include a music library. Dramatic Arts and Comparative Literature moved into the building in 1958. More recently, the College Writing Program occupied the top floor. The annex is currently occupied by the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies."
45,Tightwad Hill,"Tightwad Hill is the popular name for Charter Hill, the hill rising to the east of California Memorial Stadium at the University of California, Berkeley.  Tightwad Hill is so named as it affords a free view of the stadium's field, allowing fans of the Golden Bears to see the game free. The hill usually has its occupants, even when the stadium sports empty seats.   
Tightwad Hill is part of Charter Hill, the area behind campus that also encompasses the Big ""C"".  Tightwad Hill rises steeply about 100 feet above the east rim of the stadium, to a relatively flat area where spectators perch.  Created when Memorial Stadium was built in 1923, Tightwad Hill was created from the dirt removed during the excavation of lower Strawberry Canyon. The first time fans were seen on the hill for Cal games was on November 24th, 1923 during the inaugural game at California Memorial Stadium, which Cal won by a final score of 9–0, beating Stanford for the fifth straight year and securing their fourth straight undefeated season. Due to the stadium being sold out for the game, fans and students made their way up to the hill that had been created above the east rim of the stadium.
Since then, U.C. Berkeley students, staff, faculty, and the public have enjoyed fall days on the Hill, cheering for the Golden Bears and enjoying the view of the U.C. campus, downtown Berkeley, and the central San Francisco Bay. 
There are and have been many unique features on the hill over the years. Some of the those items/areas include or included: 

A bench that was built in a tree over 20 years ago. Another tree fell into it during the winter of 2013/2014 and, along with other trees affected by old age and storms, were cut down the week prior to the 2014 home opener. Parts of the bench though have been saved for future use somewhere in the main seating area of the Hill.
Trash cans and recycling bins to help keep the hill looking spotless following games
Terraces formed into the steep hillside to facilitate seating
""The Tightwad 50 Club"", which is the seating area below where the Tightwad Hill sign once hung from
""The Pit"", which is an area filled with broken glass below the lowest seating area on the main part of the Hill
A bench that was once below The 50 Club, which was in place from 2004-2008. It was followed by an improved version that was used for one season in 2014 before it was destroyed by drunk frat boys during the following offseasonIn 2006, the Regents of the University of California began considering a major renovation of Memorial Stadium.  One plan proposed the construction of a new seating structure, the so-called ""Eastside Seating Structure"" on the promenade on the east side of the stadium.  If this were to be built, it could block views of the field from Tightwad Hill, possibly eliminating this unusual and colorful tradition. An organization called ""Save Tightwad Hill"" sued the University, claiming that the Environmental Impact Report for the Stadium project did not adequately analyze the impacts of the planned improvements on historic resources and scenic views. The group eventually settled with the University.  Under the terms of the agreement the University agreed in concept to preserve Tightwad Hill as an important Cal Football tradition, and to include representatives of Tightwad Hill in the design process for east side improvements."
46,Sather Tower,"Sather Tower is a bell tower with clocks on its four faces on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. It is more commonly known as The Campanile ( KAMP-ə-NEE-lee, -⁠lay, also US:  KAHMP-) for its resemblance to the Campanile di San Marco in Venice. It is a recognizable symbol of the university.
Given by Jane K. Sather in memory of her husband, banker Peder Sather, it is the third-tallest bell-and-clock-tower in the world.
Its current 61-bell carillon, built around a nucleus of 12 bells also given by Jane Sather, can be heard for many miles and supports an extensive program of education in campanology.
Sather Tower also houses many of the Department of Integrative Biology's fossils (mainly from the La Brea Tar Pits) because its cool, dry interior is suited for their preservation."

Mr. Bowles was said to have three loves: horses, horticulture and the University of California.  The Bowles family is said to have lost its fortune during the Great Depression.The Hall displays appearance of a medieval castle, with a stone exterior and a wood entryway. Although a University-operated residence hall, its male-only tradition, classic facade, partitioned four-man rooms, and community facilities gave it a social fraternity atmosphere. ""Bowlesmen"" have traditionally been a tight-knit group of students who regularly practice various traditions and rituals that are exclusive to the Hall. In the 1980s, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, an example of 'Collegiate Gothic' architecture.
From 2006 to 2014, a group of Hall alumni worked with University officials to create a plan whereby the Hall would be restored and reconstituted as a co-ed Residential College via public-private financing. Following a 14-month restoration project, the Hall reopened in August 2016."

Its focus is preparing social work professionals for the public and nonprofit sectors. Berkeley Social Welfare offers an Undergraduate Major in Social Welfare with the College of Letters and Science (L&S), the M.S.W., and the Ph.D. Haviland Hall includes its own library, founded in 1957, which contains approximately 34,400 volumes and 200 active serial titles. The library originally housed volumes specifically for the social work field but was expanded in 2014 to include education, psychology and public policy. 
Social welfare as a field of study was originally located in the Economics Department and was called ""social economics"". Professor Jessica Blanche Peixotto, the second woman to earn at Ph.D. at Berkeley, was hired in 1904 to teach courses in sociology and by 1912 had shaped a curriculum in social economics focused on the poor. Professor Peixotto became the first woman at Berkeley to achieve tenured faculty status in 1918. Along with her colleagues, Lucy Ward Stebbins and Emily Noble Plehn, they developed a graduate-level curriculum in social work that same year. By 1927 these courses led to certificates in child and family services and in medical social work. An independent Department of Social Welfare was established in 1939 and the certificates were replaced with a professional Master of Arts degree in 1942. Professor Harry Cassidy, the Public Welfare Director for British Columbia became the first Dean of the new School of Social Welfare in 1944. He insisted the program be called ""social welfare"" to encompass more than social work."
78,Founders' Rock,"On the corner of Hearst Avenue and Gayley Road, in Berkeley, California, lies the Founders' Rock, the spot, according to college lore, where the 12 trustees of the College of California, the nascent University of California, Berkeley, stood on April 16, 1860, to dedicate the property they had just purchased. This is, supposedly, the same spot where Frederick Billings stood in 1866 when he remembered Bishop Berkeley's verse -- ""Westward the course of empire takes its way""—and thus inspired the name of the new city. A plaque was put on this spot on Charter Day in 1896."

85,"Campus of the University of California, Berkeley","The campus of the University of California, Berkeley and its surrounding community are home to a number of notable buildings by early 20th-century campus architect John Galen Howard, his peer Bernard Maybeck (best known for the San Francisco Palace of Fine Arts), and their colleague Julia Morgan. Later buildings were designed by architects such as Charles Willard Moore (Haas School of Business) and Joseph Esherick (Wurster Hall).

Very little of the early University of California (c. 1868–1903) remains, with the Victorian Second Empire-style South Hall (1873) and Piedmont Avenue (designed by Frederick Law Olmsted) being notable exceptions. What is considered the historic campus today was the eventual result of the 1898 ""International Competition for the Phoebe Hearst Architectural Plan for the University of California,"" funded by William Randolph Hearst’s mother and initially held in the Belgian city of Antwerp (eleven finalists were judged again in San Francisco, 1899).
This unprecedented competition came about from one-upmanship between the prominent Hearst and Stanford families of the Bay Area. In response to the founding of Stanford University, the Hearst Family decided to ""adopt"" the fledgling University of California and develop their own world-class institution. Although Emile Bénard, a Frenchman, won the competition, he disliked the ""uncultured"" San Francisco atmosphere and refused to personally revise the plan to the site. He was replaced by fourth-place winner John Galen Howard, who would later become UC Berkeley's resident campus architect. Only University House, designed by architect Albert Pissis and then home to the President of the University of California, was placed according to the original Bénard plan (today it is the home of UC Berkeley's Chancellor).

Much of the older campus is built in the Beaux-Arts Classical style, which was the style preferred by John Galen Howard and Phoebe Hearst (who paid his salary). This area is now referred to as the “classical core” of the campus. With the support of University President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, Howard designed over twenty buildings, which set the tone for the campus up until its expansion in the 1950s and '60s. These included the Hearst Greek Theatre, the Hearst Memorial Mining Building, Doe Memorial Library, California Hall, Wheeler Hall, (Old) Le Conte Hall, Gilman Hall, Haviland Hall, Wellman Hall, Sather Gate, and the 307-foot (94 m) Sather Tower (nicknamed ""the Campanile"" after its architectural inspiration, St Mark's Campanile in Venice). Buildings he regarded as temporary, nonacademic, or not particularly ""serious"" were designed in shingle or Collegiate Gothic styles, such as North Gate Hall, Dwinelle Annex, and Stephens Hall.

Buildings Founders' Rock, University House, Faculty Club and Glade, Hearst Greek Theatre, Hearst Memorial Mining Building, Doe Library, Sather Tower and Esplanade, Sather Gate and Bridge, Hearst Gymnasium, California, Durant, Wellman, Hilgard, Giannini, Wheeler, North Gate and South Halls are a California Historical Landmark and are now listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Bowles Hall—built in 1928—is California's oldest state-owned dormitory and is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

John Galen Howard retired in 1924, his support base gone with both Phoebe Hearst's death and President Wheeler's resignation in 1919. William Randolph Hearst, seeking to memorialize his mother, contributed to Howard's resignation by commissioning Bernard Maybeck and Julia Morgan to design a series of dramatic buildings on the southern part of the campus. These were originally to include a huge domed auditorium, a museum, an art school, and a women's gymnasium, all arranged on an eastward esplanade and classically oriented towards the campanile. However, only the Hearst Women's Gymnasium was completed before the Great Depression, at which point Hearst decided to focus on his estate at San Simeon instead.
The dramatic increase in enrollment during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s led to the rapid expansion of the campus, beginning with the University's appropriation of the north end of Telegraph Avenue to form Sproul Plaza and headed on its east side by Sproul Hall, a new neoclassical building for the campus administration. However, the administration moved out of Sproul and into California Hall, situated in the heart of campus, after students barricaded themselves in Sproul during the 1964 Free Speech Movement. (Today, Sproul Hall houses Student Services and the Admissions Office, and Sproul Plaza is the center of student activities.) A series of huge Brutalist concrete buildings were also built to provide much-needed housing, lab, office, and classroom space, including Evans Hall, Cory Hall, Wurster Hall, Davis Hall, McCone Hall, Zellerbach Hall, the undergraduate dorms Units 1, 2, and 3, and others.

Gray-green Evans Hall is the tallest instructional building on the campus and houses the offices of faculty in mathematics, statistics, and economics. Evans Hall is widely reviled; a recent campus development plan lists Evans Hall as a candidate for demolition within the next fifteen years. Cory Hall, the electrical engineering building, was the site of two attacks by the Unabomber in 1982 and 1985. Its neighbor, Soda Hall (computer science), is one of the few classroom buildings on campus with showers. It was completed in August 1994 at the cost of $35.5 million, raised entirely from private gifts. Dwinelle Hall is another large building on campus; its rooms are strangely numbered both because Dwinelle Hall was built with entrances on different levels on a slope and because its expansions were numbered differently from the original building. Because this confusing building is host to both large lecture classes and numerous discussion classes, it is sometimes called the ""freshman maze.""
Underneath UC Berkeley's oldest buildings is a system of steam tunnels which carry steam for heat and power. During the 1960s, Berkeley students chained the doorknobs of the Chancellor's office in protest over the Vietnam War. The Chancellor, having no other way in or out of the building, used the steam tunnels to escape. Afterwards, the exterior double doors on that building were changed so they only had one doorknob, and this remains today."

The results were presented over time in 18 books authored by Stitt and published by McGraw-Hill, John Wiley & Sons, and others. He also created and published over 70 architectural manuals through his own publishing company, Guidelines. The most recent textbook produced by Fred Stitt, The Ecological Design Handbook, was published by McGraw-Hill and recently translated into Chinese, and is used as a university textbook around the world.
Stitt and SFIA's distinguished faculty are now applying extended problem seeking and creative problem solving to every aspect of contemporary sustainable architecture. In pursuit of this work, SFIA created the first major national and international green building conferences (the Eco Wave Series) and has held recurring workshops for
design professionals and educators in over 50 cities across the U.S.

157,La Loma Park,"La Loma Park is a tract of land located in the Berkeley Hills section of the city of Berkeley, California in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Spanish word loma means ""rise/low hill"". It was the property of Captain Richard Parks Thomas, a veteran of the Civil War and Berkeley businessman. Today, it is entirely a residential area. Although hilly throughout, its average elevation is about 614 feet (187 m).
Captain Thomas' home was located on the site of what is today Greenwood Terrace. Some of the large trees here were originally planted by Captain Thomas and managed to survive the devastating fire of 1923 which swept through this part of Berkeley.  Thomas enclosed his vast property with a low, whitewashed fence on its north, west and south sides, leaving the east side---the upper hillside---open.
Captain Thomas was the owner of the Standard Soap Company in West Berkeley, president of the California National Bank of San Francisco, and owner of the Berkeley Ferryboat Line. He had a reputation as a friend of the working man and an eccentric character, and was probably the first person who inspired the nickname for the district: ""Nut Hill"". An old map includes a notation that he kept an illegal still on his property. He devised a scheme for an aerial tramway running from the Berkeley flatlands to the hills. Every Fourth of July, he fired off an old civil war cannon from ""Fort La Loma"", a plaza he constructed up the hill from his home. The site is today occupied by ""Hume Cloister,"" also known as ""Hume Castle"" on Buena Vista Way, named for Samuel James Hume and his wife, who had architect John Hudson Thomas design a reduced-scale replica of a cloister in Toulouse, France.
In the 19th century, a stone quarry was opened at the head of Codornices Creek, abutting the north boundary of the La Loma Park tract. Some of the rock quarried here had a pinkish hue and was used to tint the concrete sidewalks and pathways throughout parts of North Berkeley, a practice that has been maintained by the City to this day, albeit using tint from other sources.  The quarry was closed by the 1940s.  In the late 1960s the quarry was made into a public park, ""Glendale-La Loma Park"".
A number of notable people have lived in the La Loma Park/Nut Hill area over the years, including many professors from the University of California, Berkeley, among them, J. Robert Oppenheimer and his nemesis-colleague, Edward Teller. Famed San Francisco Bay Area architect Bernard Maybeck made his home here, as well as the homes of several others in the neighborhood, a fact memorialized by Maybeck Twin Drive off of Buena Vista above La Loma. Further up Buena Vista is a structure known as the Temple of the Wings with its Grecian columns, an early 20th-century bohemian hangout.
A former public school, Hillside Elementary School is located in the La Loma district on the block bounded by Le Roy Avenue, Buena Vista Way and La Loma Avenue. It is registered as a local historic landmark. The present structure was built after the 1923 fire destroyed its predecessor, located on the southwest corner of Le Roy and Virginia Street. Hillside was closed as a public school both because of a declining school-age population and because it sits immediately adjacent to the Hayward Fault, which runs directly behind it on La Loma Avenue.
Upon being subdivided and developed, some residents of the district formed the La Loma Improvement Club.  One of their efforts included subsidizing the northward extension of the Euclid Avenue streetcar line from Hilgard to the Berryman Reservoir, which today is adjacent to Codornices Park and the Berkeley Rose Garden.  The Euclid line was first constructed in 1903 as an extension of the Telegraph Avenue streetcar line, and originally terminated at Hilgard and Arch streets.  The extension to the Berryman Reservoir (Rose Street, now Rose Walk) was completed in August 1910.  A subsequent further extension was made in 1912, across Codornices Canyon, by means of a trestle for both streetcar and autos.  The line was built to Regal Road and remained active until the end of all streetcar service in 1948."

After coalescing in the mid-1970s as a culinary destination, the neighborhood received its ""Gourmet Ghetto"" nickname in the late 1970s from writer Alice Kahn. Early, founding influences were Peet's Coffee, Chez Panisse and the Cheese Board Collective. Alice Medrich began her chain of Cocolat chocolate stores there.
The neighborhood, anchored by Alice Waters' Chez Panisse, became the center of farm-to-table food sourcing, using selected locally grown produce, especially naturally and sustainably grown—preferably organic ingredients. Waters and a loosely organized left-leaning coterie of friends and colleagues actively promoted the idea of socially conscious eating. Many former staff at Chez Panisse have gone on to start their own restaurants, bakeries, and food shops in the wider San Francisco Bay Area."

The park is mostly grass with a scattering of trees and includes pedestrian and bicycle paths, a dog park, a basketball court, and a small ball field. The dog park was the first off-leash dog park in the US.

The park was created ad hoc by Berkeley citizens in connection with the People's Park controversy of the late 1960s. The land was originally occupied by residences which were acquired, then razed by BART in the construction of its subway through Berkeley.  After the trench for the subway was filled in, BART planned to construct apartment complexes on the strip. However, before their plans were complete, Berkeley citizens began planting sod and trees and dubbed the strip ""People's Park Annex"".
After much haggling and public discussion, BART agreed to turn the Hearst strip over to the City of Berkeley. The park was formally named ""Ohlone Park"" after the name of the local indigenous people."

172,"University High School (Oakland, California)","University High School was a public high school serving the northwestern portion of Oakland, California.  It originally opened in 1923 at what was 5714 Grove Street. Due to the proximity of the campus to the City of Berkeley, ""UNI"" gained the reputation of the ""feeder"" high school of Oakland of students directly to the University of California. The high school was closed following World War II in 1948.
In 1954, the campus was converted into first location of Oakland City College, which later became Merritt College.  Merritt College moved to its new campus in 1967.  In the early 1970s the location temporarily became a high school again, as Oakland Technical High School moved its students into the campus while its normal location was retrofitted for earthquake safety.  At the time, many called this site ""Old Tech,"" although Oakland Tech was actually opened at its current location in 1914, before University High School.
After the ""Tech"" students moved back to their original campus, the building remained vacant for several years. At one point, it was used as the filming location for the 1987 film The Principal.The location has been rehabilitated and is now shared between the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute and the North Oakland Senior Center.  Grove Street was subsequently renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Way.

174,Grizzly Peak (Berkeley Hills),"Grizzly Peak is  a summit in the Berkeley Hills above Berkeley, California.  The peak is located on the border between Alameda and Contra Costa counties, within the boundaries of Tilden Regional Park, and directly behind the University of California, Berkeley campus.
The peak was named for the California grizzly bear which inhabited the local area until the late 1800s.  The last sighting locally was by a man who was reportedly killed by a grizzly in Strawberry Canyon below Grizzly Peak in the 1860s.  The first local killing of a grizzly by a European occurred in 1772, also along Strawberry Creek just west of what is today the UC Berkeley campus, within what is now downtown Berkeley.  The shooting by Spanish soldiers was recorded by Father Juan Crespi.  The last grizzly in all of California was killed in the Sierra foothills east of Fresno in August 1922.Grizzly Peak became more accessible in 1932 when Grizzly Peak Boulevard was constructed along the ridge line of the Berkeley Hills.  The name was extended to the previously-constructed ridge line stretch of Euclid Avenue to the north shortly thereafter. This portion was and remains a residential area of Berkeley while the original stretch is largely undeveloped. Grizzly Peak Boulevard now extends from Kenyon Avenue in Kensington in the north, through Berkeley and Oakland to an intersection with Skyline Blvd. above Oakland to the south. Before Grizzly Peak Boulevard was constructed, the location of its current intersection with Claremont (before 1892 known as Telegraph Road) and Fish Ranch Road was historically an important pass through the Berkeley Hills, before the tunnel that preceded today's Caldecott Tunnel was constructed through the hills in 1903; an inn and stage stop called the Summit House was located here."

181,"1923 Berkeley, California fire","The 1923 Berkeley Fire was a conflagration that consumed some 640 structures, including 584 homes in the densely-built neighborhoods north of the campus of the University of California in Berkeley, California on September 17, 1923.
Although the exact cause was never determined, the fire began in the undeveloped chaparral and grasslands of Wildcat Canyon, just east of the ridgeline of the Berkeley Hills, and was propelled over the ridge and southwestward just south of Codornices Creek by a strong, gusty, and intensely dry northeasterly wind. The fire quickly blew up as it swept through the La Loma Park and Northside neighborhoods of Berkeley, overwhelming the capabilities of the Berkeley Fire Department to stop it. A number of UC students fought the advance of the fire as it approached the north edge of the University of California campus, at Hearst Avenue. The other edge of the fire was fought by firefighters as it advanced on downtown Berkeley along the east side of Shattuck Avenue north of University Avenue. Firefighters were rushed in from neighboring Oakland, and San Francisco sent firefighters by ferry across the bay.
Firefighting efforts were hampered by the inadequacy of water mains in northern Berkeley, where rapid development after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake had outgrown the water supply in the fire area. Firefighters trying to fight the fire connected to hydrants in the area that hissed dry and were hampered also by the predominance of cedar shake roofs. The strong and dry wind lifted burning shakes off burning houses and quickly spread the fire. The fire was halted only when the northeasterly winds died down and were replaced by the cool, humid afternoon sea breeze. The fire lines were established at Hearst and Shattuck Avenues, where larger diameter water mains delivered a reliable water supply for firefighting.
Building styles in North Berkeley changed dramatically after the 1923 fire, with stucco and tile roof homes largely, but not entirely, replacing the wood-sided and cedar-shaked construction styles popularized by the Berkeley Hillside Club before the fire.
As a belated result of the fire, the City of Berkeley constructed a fire station in the hills at 2931 Shasta Road (at Queens Road) just below Grizzly Peak Blvd, in 1948. In the early 2000s, this station was replaced and relocated to a nearby site just above Grizzly Peak Blvd. at 3000 Shasta Road, on the interface between the residential area and Tilden Regional Park, very close to the putative origin of the 1923 fire."

"
195,Northbrae Tunnel,"The Northbrae Tunnel, also referred to as the Solano Avenue Tunnel, was built as a commuter electric railroad tunnel in the northern part of Berkeley, California, and was later converted to street use.
In 1910 the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) was electrifying its steam-engine drawn ferry-train line (to San Francisco) from Oakland Pier via Shattuck Avenue to Vine Street in Berkeley and extending it north along the base of the Berkeley Hills to newly developing neighborhoods of Berkeley at Northbrae and Thousand Oaks. The route chosen was Henry Street and Sutter Street to its intersection with Hopkins. At this point a ridge carrying Marin and Los Angeles Avenues blocked the way. After investigating (1) a route around the ridge and (2) a cut through the ridge with bridges over it, it was decided to use the route of the cut but make it a tunnel instead, under Marin and Los Angeles Avenues just west of their intersection with The (Marin) Circle. The cut-and-cover method of tunnel construction was used. The excess soil was used to elevate the railroad right-of-way adjacent to Henry Street so that a bridge could be put in over Eunice Street and the right-of-way would go over a culvert containing Codornices Creek. The tunnel curved to the west so that the railroad could continue through a small canyon to the intersection of Solano Avenue and The Alameda and then to Thousand Oaks station at Solano and Colusa Avenues.The railroad was completed in 1911 and inspection trains were run at the end of that year, with service beginning January 1, 1912.
The SP ferry-train service was changed to bridge-train service operated by its subsidiary, Interurban Electric Railway (IER) across the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge in December, 1939. The IER ended service July 26, 1941, but the tracks in Berkeley were made available to the Key System, which extended service to Hopkins and Sutter Streets (the stop formerly called Northbrae) beginning August 6, 1941. Service was extended through the tunnel to a new terminal at Solano Avenue and the Alameda on December 6, 1942. All bridge-train service ended on April 20, 1958.A paved roadway was installed in the tunnel by the City of Berkeley, and was opened to traffic on December 15, 1962, extending Solano Avenue through the tunnel to connect with Sutter Street."

200,"Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd (Berkeley, California)","The Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd is an historic Carpenter Gothic style Episcopal church building located at 1001 Hearst Street at Ninth Street (1823 Ninth Street) in Berkeley, California. Built in 1878, it was designed in the Carpenter Gothic style of architecture by architect Charles L. Bugbee who was associated with his father Samuel C. Bugbee in the San Francisco firm of S. C. Bugbee & Son. Charles L. Bugbee patterned it after the Carpenter Gothic style Mendocino Presbyterian Church, which the firm had designed in 1867.  While all of the Mendocino church's exterior walls are of board and batten siding, only the upper walls of Good Shepherd are board and batten while the lower walls are of Dutch lap weatherboarding. Both churches feature tall side-entrance bell towers, steep gabled roofs and lancet windows, but according to writer Daniella Thompson: ""...the Church of the Good Shepherd is considerably more ornate and playful than its severe Presbyterian model, ...""

201,"Westbrae, Berkeley, California","Westbrae is a neighborhood in the northern part of Berkeley, California in the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay Area.  Westbrae is ""centered"" on the intersection of Santa Fe Avenue and Gilman Street, although the main extent is east, south and west of this intersection, with the Albany city limit only a short distance north. It lies at an elevation of 79 feet (24 m).  The neighborhood is mainly residential, with a small commercial section along Gilman from Santa Fe to Tevlin Street.  In the past, businesses consisted of liquor and grocery stores but now are small restaurants, a natural food store, bakeries, and a nursery. The elevated tracks of the BART Richmond line cut diagonally across Westbrae, crossing over Gilman in the commercial section.  There is a church called the Westbrae Bible Church located nearby on the corner of Hopkins and Ordway about three blocks from the center of the Westbrae neighborhood.  The current, most notable business is the acclaimed Bay Area restaurant Lalime's.
Until about 1979, the tracks of the Santa Fe railroad ran beside where the BART elevated and underground lines are today.  Today, the Ohlone Greenway, a bicycle and pedestrian path, follows the old right-of-way. Paralleling the Santa Fe tracks to the east were the tracks of the Key System's G-Westbrae line.  The ""G"" terminated at a small station just short of the city limits at Codornices Creek.  The origin of Westbrae is directly connected to the Key System.  The Key System was part of a larger enterprise which included real estate, the Realty Syndicate.  The name ""Westbrae"" was given by the Key developers and included tracts north of Codornices Creek in Albany.  A street through the heart of this area was, and remains, ""Key Route Boulevard"".  There were future plans to extend the G-Westbrae line northward to serve the development area, but this never happened.  The ""G"" remained a trolley shuttle between the terminal near Gilman and Santa Fe, connecting with the H transbay line at Sacramento Street and University Avenue instead of being extended and transformed into a full-fledged transbay line of its own. AC Transit operates a Transbay express bus line along Key Route designated G, and also an H line to this day; the designations are inherited from the Key System lines."

The Cragmont area was mostly grassland with oak and bay laurel trees in the canyons until the beginnings of the American era.  The area was named for the various rock outcroppings which occur throughout the district.  It was first developed as grazing land in the late 19th century.  When a one-mile (1.6 km) exclusion zone for the sale of liquor was imposed with respect to the campus of the University of California, a local farmer opened up a saloon at what is now the corner of Spruce Street and Marin Avenue.  Today, there are no commercial areas in the district.
In the early 20th century, a streetcar line operated by the Key System was opened up along Euclid Avenue to Hilgard Street near the University campus.  It was soon extended up Euclid as far as Regal Road, one block south of Marin Avenue.  The area was immediately put up for sale for residential development.
Many homes in the Cragmont area command an outstanding view of San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate.  On the other hand, houses are closely spaced and there are many trees, posing a very high fire hazard during episodes of warm, dry and windy weather.  There are also a number of active slides, and the Hayward Fault, a major branch of the San Andreas Fault, cuts right through the district, roughly along the alignment of (from south to north) La Loma-Euclid-Spruce streets."

The station began in Berkeley in 1922 as KRE, the former callsign of a marine radio station aboard a World War I merchant marine steamship, Florence H., destroyed in an April 17, 1918, explosion at Quiberon Bay, France. Later programming was simulcast on KRE-FM and there were occasional AM/FM stereo broadcasts, including some classical music programming.  KRE's call letters changed to KPAT in 1963, then back to KRE in 1972.  The call letters KBLX were adopted in 1986, then changed to KBFN in 1989 and back to KBLX in 1990.  The current call letters, KVTO, were adopted in 1994.The Maxwell Electric Company put KRE on the air on March 11, 1922, with studios and transmitter at the Claremont Resort Hotel.  In May of that year, KRE was sold to the Berkeley Daily Gazette.  It was bought in January 1927 by the First Congregational Church of Berkeley, which moved the studios and built a new transmitter.  In January 1930, the Chapel of the Chimes (an Oakland funeral home) bought KRE.  Ownership passed in December 1936 to Central California Broadcasters, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chapel of the Chimes.  New studios and transmitter were built at 601 Ashby Avenue from 1937 to 1938.  KRE-FM went on the air on February 14, 1949, with a transmitter on Round Hill Mountain, which was moved to the Ashby Avenue near Berkeley's Aquatic Park site in 1950.  In March 1963, KRE was taken over by the Wright Broadcasting Company of Paterson, New Jersey."

216,Donald and Helen Olsen House,"The Donald and Helen Olsen House, in Berkeley, California, was built in 1954.It is a Modernist, International-style house designed by architect Donald Olsen.  Olsen is a native of Minnesota who studied under Walter Gropius at Harvard and established an architecture practice in Berkeley in 1953.The house is situated on a slope in the North Berkeley Hills near John Hinkel Park.  The structure's main floor was built above ground level to maximize the site's views of San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge.  However, the view has been obscured over the years by the growth of mature trees on the property.  The National Park Service described the house's style as follows: ""The house's design is specifically the International style popularized in Europe by architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, and Le Corbusier. The Olsen House displays the geometries, ethos, strict formalism and rigor that embody this utopian style."" The house also includes a mural by artist Claire Falkenstein.
The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on October 1, 2010. The listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service's weekly list of October 8, 2010.

227,Oaks Park (stadium),"Oaks Park, formally known as the Oakland Baseball Park, and at times nicknamed Emeryville Park, was a baseball stadium in Emeryville, California.  It was primarily used for baseball, and was the home field of the Oakland Oaks Pacific Coast League baseball team.  It opened in 1913 and held 11,000 people (4,000 in the grandstand and 7,000 in the two bleachers). The Oaks played there until 1955.

The ballpark was located within the city limits of Emeryville, between Oakland and Berkeley. The site was on the block bounded by 45th Street (north, first base); San Pablo Avenue (east, third base); Park Avenue (south, left field); and Watts Street (west, right field). The stadium did not front directly on San Pablo where a strip of various small commercial buildings stood, now replaced by a single one-story commercial building with several chain businesses.
Oaks Park was highly accessible, as a major streetcar line ran on San Pablo Avenue, and a station serving several of the Key System's transbay commuter rail lines existed a few blocks south at Yerba Buena Avenue.
The Oaks had been playing most of their home games (except Thursdays and Sunday mornings) at Recreation Park in San Francisco, starting when that new ballpark opened in 1907. Even after moving back to Oakland, the Oaks would play a number of games each year in San Francisco. PCL founding father J. Cal Ewing owned both the Oaks and the San Francisco Seals from 1903 until sometime in the 1920s, at which point the Oaks began playing all their games in Oakland.
The park was not well maintained in its later years, causing a steep decline in attendance. These factors forced the Oaks to move to Vancouver in 1956. That move proved prescient, as the New York Giants moved to San Francisco two years later and would have likely displaced the Oaks in any event.
Until recently, the site of the park was partly an empty, fenced-off lot, with Pixar Studios overlapping it where Watts Street used to run through. In 2011, it was incorporated into the second phase of Pixar Studios' expansion. It is now a parking lot with a public bicycle path and park on the San Pablo side of the property, across the street from Oaks Card Club."

Its residents were employed in the construction of the surrounding subdivisions and were likely to vote against incorporation as a separate city. The neighborhood was first subdivided in 1909 and 1917 after a failed proposal to move the state capital to Berkeley, in which the area would have become a large public park near the capitol building. Originally an unincorporated area north of Berkeley, it was built as a commuter suburb at the northern terminus of three interurban rail lines.

263,Temescal Creek (Northern California),"Temescal Creek is one of the principal watercourses in the city of Oakland, California, United States.
The word ""temescal"" derives from the word temescalli, which means ""sweat house"" in the Nahuatl language of the Mexica (""Aztec"") people of Mexico. The name was given to the creek when it became part of the Peralta's Rancho San Antonio. It is surmised that the Peraltas or perhaps one of their ranch hands (vaqueros) had seen local indigenous (Ohlone) structures along the creek similar to those in other parts of New Spain which were called temescalli.
Three forks begin in the Berkeley Hills in the northeastern section of Oakland (also referred to as the Oakland hills south of the Caldecott Tunnel), part of the Pacific Coast Ranges, coming together in the Temescal district of Oakland, then flowing westerly across Oakland and Emeryville to San Francisco Bay.
The north fork of Temescal Creek was renamed ""Harwood's Creek"" in the mid 19th century after an early claimant to grazing lands in the canyon above the Claremont neighborhood, retired sea captain and Oakland wharfinger William Harwood.  It was renamed yet again ""Claremont Creek"" in the early 20th century after a residential development in the same vicinity, today's Claremont district.
The middle fork flows through Temescal Canyon, now mostly in underground culverts beneath the large freeway leading to the Caldecott Tunnel.  It joins the south fork at Lake Temescal.  Before the tunnel project (1934-37), this fork entered the lake via a prominent inlet that was traversed by a trestle bridge of the Sacramento Northern Railroad.  The inlet was filled in and the trestle replaced by a large concrete embankment which exists to this day.
The south fork begins in the northern section of Oakland's Montclair district, flowing southwest out of a canyon in the hills alongside Thornhill Road, then turning abruptly northwestward in the linear valley formed by the Hayward Fault.  It then flows into Lake Temescal, a natural sag pond which was dammed in the 19th century to increase its capacity for use as a reservoir.  Lake Temescal is now a public park.
The creek continues out of Lake Temescal, curving westerly around the end of the shutter ridge in the Rockridge district of Oakland, where it joins the north fork (Claremont Creek) at approximately the intersection of Forrest Street and Miles Avenue adjacent to the Grove-Shafter Freeway (State Route 24). It then flows parallel to Claremont Avenue above ground just before crossing Telegraph Avenue.  It then flows in a culvert across Telegraph Avenue until about 47th Street where it makes a westward turn, flowing toward the Bay."
264,Emeryville mudflat sculptures,"The Emeryville mudflat sculptures were a series of found object structures along the San Francisco Bay shoreline of Emeryville, California, largely constructed from discarded materials found on-site such as driftwood.

Its target group for this service is the members of interracial marriage families. In 2009 it offered 29 total Chinese language classes and 15 Chinese culture classes.
In recent years there is a growing number of non-Chinese-heritage students attending the school, possibly due to rising Chinese influence in the global economy. To meet the needs of the school's diverse student body EBCS has implemented several initiatives to ensure the school continue to provide quality education. First, the school put more rigors around academic prerequisites and age requirements for new student enrollment. The intent was to ensure basic standards for all classes so teachers can focus on delivering a quality education. Also, the school requires all teachers to submit their lesson plans for the entire academic year so that progress can be tracked. The school also conducted a school-wide assessment (excluding kindergarten). The purpose of this test was to ensure standards were being met across all levels, and to identify students that need additional help. In 2009, the school adopted new textbooks and multimedia materials designed specifically for Chinese-as-second-language (CSL) learners.

Formed in Paris in the early 20th century under impresario Sergei Diaghilev, the Ballets Russes went on to redefine the art of ballet. Guidi studied under Raoul Pausé for many years, himself a former student of Ballets Russes dancer and choreographer Adolf Bolm, and thus inherited the Ballet Russes tradition of fusing classical training with unrestrained choreographic possibilities.
Noted revivals by Oakland Ballet include works by renowned choreographers Kurt Jooss, Michel Fokine, Charles Weidman, and Antony Tudor and the first re-staging of works by Bronislava Nijinska in the United States. Championing American masterpieces as well, Oakland Ballet has presented Eugene Loring's ""Billy the Kid"", Ruthanna Boris's ""Cakewalk"", and Agnes de Mille's ""Fall River Legend"". Along with Guidi's own repertoire of choreography, Oakland Ballet has produced celebrated works by local choreographers such as Val Caniparoli, Carlos Carvajal, Margaret Jenkins, Alonzo King, Michael Lowe, Robert Moses, and Amy Seiwert, among others.
In 2000, Oakland Ballet ushered in a new era with a new Artist Director, celebrated Dance Theatre of Harlem dancer, Karen Brown. Brown brought a renewed focus to the production of ballets by local and contemporary choreographers while continuing the company’s commitment to performing great classical works. In 2007 OBC celebrated the return of founding Artistic Director, Ronn Guidi. Mr. Guidi retired for the final time in 2008 and Oakland Ballet continued to present productions under the direction of guest Artistic Directors through the spring of 2010.
In 2010, the company welcomed internationally acclaimed choreographer and director Graham Lustig as Artistic Director. Lustig’s career as a dancer, artistic director, and choreographer parallels OBC’s tradition of presenting historically vibrant work while championing new choreography.
Under Lustig’s leadership, the Oakland Ballet has rekindled its commitment to serving the local community by producing ballet that is vibrant in its artistic vision and draws on the Bay Area’s great talent. Oakland Ballet’s longtime collaboration with Michael Morgan, Music Director and Conductor of Oakland East Bay Symphony, continues to be a hallmark of the annual performance of Graham Lustig’s ""The Nutcracker"" at the Paramount Theatre.
Since his appointment as Artistic Director of Oakland Ballet Company in 2010, Lustig has presented five seasons of his Nutcracker and three spring repertory productions, Forwards! (2011), Diaghilev Imagery (2013), and Oakland-esque (2014), with a focus on commissioned works by esteemed Bay Area choreographers. Lustig’s ballet Infinitum was included in the West Wave Dance Festival (2011) and he initiated Oakland Ballet Company’s annual summer Ballet Boot Camp, a two-week dance and choreography workshop now in its fifth year, as well as ongoing ballet training opportunities at The Academy at Oakland Ballet Company.

313,Kaiser Center,"Kaiser Center, also called the Kaiser Building, is a 28-story office building located at 300 Lakeside Drive, adjacent to Lake Merritt, in downtown Oakland, California, designed by the architectural firm of Welton Becket & Associates of Los Angeles. The property is bounded by Lakeside Drive, which terminates and joins Harrison Street at the site, 20th-, 21st-, and Webster-streets. When completed in 1960, it was Oakland's tallest building, as well as the largest office tower west of the Rocky Mountains. A three-story office/retail building adjacent to the main tower was completed in 1963. Kaiser Center was the headquarters of Kaiser Industries, a Fortune 500 conglomerate that was headed by industrialist Edgar F. Kaiser at the time the building was constructed.
The building's roof garden was designed by San Francisco-based landscape architecture firm, Theodore Osmundson & Associates, and was the first built in the United States after World War II. While legend has it that Henry J. Kaiser resided in a penthouse apartment on the 28th floor, by 1960 the elder Kaiser had turned over the Oakland-based company to his son, and pursued projects based in Honolulu. It is much more likely that his son Edgar, who was in charge of Kaiser industries and a major power broker in the Bay Area by the time the building was commissioned, was the person who occupied any residential apartments. According to a National Park Service study, Edgar commissioned the architecturally significant rooftop garden after the building had been designed, inspired by the gardens of Rockefeller Center in N.Y.The building is currently home to the headquarters of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), which recently relocated from its former administration building atop the Lake Merritt station, due to earthquake concerns.

323,"Blake Garden (Kensington, California)","Blake Garden is a 10.6 acre (4.3 ha) landscape laboratory and public garden located at 70 Rincon Road in Kensington, California, United States. It is a teaching facility for the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning of the University of California, Berkeley. It is also the site of Blake House, formerly the residence of the President of the University of California.  The garden is open to the public during weekdays; no admission fee is charged.
The Blake's original family home was on Piedmont Avenue, where Memorial Stadium now stands.  The building of the stadium prompted the building of two homes in the Kensington hills, Anson Blake's house, now Blake Garden, and the Edwin Blake house, now the Carmelite Monastery.  The garden was deeded to the Landscape Architecture Department in 1957 by Anson and Anita Blake, and title passed to the University upon Anita Blake's death in 1962.  Five years later, Blake House became the UC President's official residence, until 2009.
The siting of Blake house is integral to the garden's design: it shelters the Formal Garden from the strong prevailing winds off the Golden Gate. The grounds for both estates were designed by Mrs. Blake's sister, Mabel Symmes, who graduated from the university's Landscape Architecture Department in 1914.  Ms. Symmes' original plan showed great sensitivity to the site.  Much of her original plan can still be seen in the design of the Pink and Yellow Gardens with its grotto, inspired by the Villa Tusculana at Frascati, Italy and the reflecting pool which was part of a system to take advantage of underground water. The Redwood Canyon, with redwood cuttings brought from the Blake's property in Berkeley and St. Helena, is planted along a natural waterway.  The original plan also shows a lake in the Australian Hollow, taking advantage of the high water table in that part of the garden.  In 2010 this area was restored to a native wetland by UC students, volunteers and Blake Garden staff.  The wetland now provides habitat to a community of Pacific chorus frogs and area birds.
Other parts of the garden include the Mediterranean Garden on the western side of house, a showcase of drought-tolerant plants from the world's Mediterranean climates; the Cottage Garden, full of roses, flowers for cutting, vegetables and herbs; the Square, with its water lily-filled pond, and beds brimming with low-water perennials; and the Event Lawn and surrounding beds, another example of water-smart gardening.
The garden is home to nearly 1500 plant species, over fifty bird species, as well as raccoons, frogs, salamanders, and the occasional fox.  The garden is all organic, with many sustainable practices including four kinds of composting, rainwater harvesting, and hives of honeybees.  Additionally, the Create with Nature Zone offers a space for visitors of all ages to experiment and build with materials collected from the garden."

327,Cleveland Cascade,"The Cleveland Cascade is a 250-foot-long ornamental stairway near Lake Merritt in Oakland, California, with cascades in the center, designed in 1923 by Howard Gilkey. It opened with great civic pride as ""one of the few things of this kind in the West"". The Cascade was reportedly modeled after features in the hill towns of Italy. From the lakefront downhill end, wide concrete steps rise to a landing, then divide around a round-topped fountain niche and pool, and continue to the top following the middle landing as two narrow stairways on either side of a series of concrete bowls that form the cascade. Water flowed down over twenty concrete bowls past colored lights.
It was adequately maintained into the early 1940s but then began to suffer from neglect and resulting disrepair. Until about 1950 the bowls were illuminated at night by colored lights, and an electric pump returned water from the pool to the top of the cascade.  The lights and water were shut off sometime in the 1950s, and the bowls were filled in. As “Cleveland Stairs,” the Cascade never lost its popularity.  The feature is an active pedestrian thoroughfare and popular with joggers.Over the past decade efforts have been underway to restore the Cascade to its past glory."

Today, it marks part of the boundary between Alameda County and Contra Costa County. The main stem, running through a deep canyon that separates Berkeley from Kensington, is joined below San Pablo Avenue by a fan of tributaries, their lower reaches mostly in culverts. The largest of these is Middle or Blackberry Creek, a southern branch.
The creek is named for Albany Hill, formerly called Cerrito de San Antonio, a prominent (elevation 294 ft.) isolated hill on the shoreline of San Francisco Bay in Albany (The hill is now some distance inland due to Bay fill). Cerrito Creek, joined by a fan of other small creeks, formerly meandered to the Bay through a large marsh just north of the hill."

It is three stories high and houses the mayor's office, the city council chamber, hearing rooms, and a police station with a firing range below in the basement. The thinner second tier follows; it is a ten-story office tower. The top floor of this section (the 12th floor) houses a 36-cell jail with an outdoor yard that has gone unused since the 1960s. Above the second tier is the two-story podium with a clock tower on top. The exterior is built of white granite and terra cotta, while the inside is built of white and black marble.

With a population of 428,827 as of 2018, it serves as a trade center for the San Francisco Bay Area; its Port of Oakland is the busiest port in the San Francisco Bay, the entirety of Northern California, and the fifth busiest in the United States of America. An act to incorporate the city was passed on May 4, 1852, and incorporation was later approved on March 25, 1854, which officially made Oakland a city. Oakland is a charter city.Oakland's territory covers what was once a mosaic of California coastal terrace prairie, oak woodland, and north coastal scrub. Its land served as a rich resource when its hillside oak and redwood timber were logged to build San Francisco. Oakland's fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. In the late 1860s, Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the Transcontinental Railroad. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, many San Francisco citizens moved to Oakland, enlarging the city's population, increasing its housing stock, and improving its infrastructure.

Two Oakland public schools are included in the area, Montera Middle School and Joaquin Miller Elementary School. There is no business section in Piedmont Pines. Although listed as a distinct district, realtors-architects, city government, and many Piedmont Pines residents have long considered the neighborhood as part of the larger Montclair district. Piedmont Pines is relatively remote from the city center and generally less known than Montclair; many Oaklanders do not seem to know of Piedmont Pines and consider this area to be part of the Montclair district, given that architecturally, geographically, demographically, and economically, the two affluent areas are virtually indistinguishable.
The neighborhood's real estate includes a 1957 mid-century modern mansion by Oakland-born architect Roger Lee and an Arts and Crafts house rented by Grateful Dead sound engineer Owsley Stanley."

Although the city of Oakland officially calls the larger district Prescott, the 1980s generation called it the boondocks and then The Lower Bottoms, and many of the new gentrifying residents prefer the even older Oakland Point, what ever one believes the name to be, its many names point to the overwhelming fact that the neighborhood is indeed gentrifying and is undergoing an intense transition and struggle for its very identity similar to what occurred in New York's Lower East Side neighborhood two decades earlier."
364,Oakland Hotel,"The Oakland Hotel is a historic building in Oakland, California. It was built as a luxury hotel by P.J.

367,Pardee Home,"The Pardee Home is a house in Oakland, California, that was home to three generations of the Pardee family. It is now a non-profit museum, showing over 100 years of the life of a prominent California family. The house, a well-preserved example of Italianate architecture, is a city landmark, a California Historical Landmark, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The house was constructed in 1868 by California State Senator Enoch H. Pardee. His son, George Pardee, a Governor of California, also inhabited the house, inheriting it after his father's death. After George's death in 1941, it passed on to his two daughters, Madeline and Helen (the same name as her mother), who lived in the house until their deaths in 1980 and 1981 respectively.
The interior of the house is the main attraction of the museum. George's wife Helen collected knick-knacks from all over the world, including scrimshaw from Alaska, tobacco pipes from the Philippines, and a giant elk head. She was fond of giving house tours to show off her collection. All of the furnishings are original and the house looks as it did in 1981.
The original carriage house and stable are still standing and the entire complex is part of Oakland's Preservation Park Historic District.

Cypress Village is one of the three housing projects in West Oakland, along with the Campbell Village Court and the Acorn Projects.
Cypress Village was built by the Oakland Housing Authority after World War II, when many African-Americans began to migrate to Oakland. It was one of four all-black segregated projects built at the time.  After the Cypress Freeway was built in 1954-1957 immediately in front of the project, most whites and middle-class blacks left the neighborhood to avoid the noise and pollution.  By the 1980s Cypress Village was a ""drug supermarket"" where Huey P. Newton purchased drugs.  The neighborhood suffered further disruption in 1989 when the freeway collapsed in the Loma Prieta earthquake.  However, at the city of Oakland's insistence, the State of California rebuilt the freeway to avoid the neighborhood and instead cleaned up contamination on its property and, fifteen years later, completed a boulevard on the site named the Mandela Parkway, with a landscaped park in the median.  Cypress Village is the home of rapper J Stalin of the Livewire record label.Due to close proximity, skirmishes between  Cypress Village and neighboring Acorn as well as Lower Bottoms occur frequently. In order to reduce the violence between the two housing projects, in 2003 rappers from both Acorn and Cypress released an underground mixtape titled Acorn & Cypress inspired by other unity rap albums like the Bloods and Crips Bangin' on Wax releases. Since then, West Oakland based rap label Livewire Records founded by J Stalin (who originates from Cypress Village) has signed numerous rappers from both housing units including Acorn resident Shady Nate."

Allen became the first Chancellor of UCLA. However, the 1951 reorganization was stalled by resistance from Sproul and his allies, and it was not until Kerr succeeded Sproul as President that UC was able to evolve into a system from 1957 to 1960.In the 21st century, the University of California has 10 campuses, a combined student body of 280,380 students, 21,200 faculty members, 144,000 staff members and over 1.86 million living alumni, as  governed by a semi-autonomous Board of Regents.

However, Upper Oakmore represents an even greater concentration of affluence, as this section of Oakmore has, since its inception, featured large, architecturally outstanding hillside estates, many of which now have earned multimillion-dollar listings and rival the mansions and estates found in Oakland's better known upper-end neighborhoods such as Crocker Highlands, Montclair-Piedmont Pines, and upper Rockridge/Claremont Pines."
393,Old Oakland,"Old Oakland is a historic district in downtown Oakland, California.  The area is located on the northwest side of Broadway, between the City Center complex and the Jack London Square district, and across Broadway from Chinatown.
The Old Oakland district was the ""original"" downtown Oakland during the 1860s after Central Pacific Railroad constructed a terminus on 7th Street.  By the 1870s, elegant brick Victorian hotels were being built in the blocks surrounding the railroad station to accommodate travelers.  The ground floor of the hotels were designed as series of narrow shops so that pedestrians would pass by many of them just walking down the block.  The architectural styles of the time featured tall, cast-iron columns and large plate-glass windows.
The downtown began its decline after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, when the shopping district began moving to the blocks north of 14th.
In the 1970s and 1980s developers carefully rehabilitated and restored a block along 9th Street between Washington Street and Broadway, known as ""Victorian Row"".  Notable structures on Victorian Row include the 1878 Nicholl Block building.
In its early days, the Oakland Tribune rented a small office on 9th Street.  A sign for the Tribune office can still be seen hanging outside the building today (2007).  A farmer's market is also held every Friday on the same stretch of 9th Street.
As of 2008, the neighborhood continues to gentrify as a 'downtown lifestyle' district, more bistros and boutiques have cropped-up, as more market-rate condominiums have been constructed nearby, and as transit-oriented development retail and housing become more and more in demand."

Adjacent to Acorn, there are three high-rise buildings known as the City Towers (formally named Apollo Housing) that resemble the high-rises of Chicago and New York City. Technically, City Towers (or ""The Highrises"" as they are known to locals) are a separate community of housing projects however, during the renovation of Acorn in the 1990s, many of the original residents of Acorn were relocated to City Towers. As a result, City Towers are often mistaken as being part of the same public housing units as Acorn.
Acorn is home to the Acorn street gang. Due to close proximity, skirmishes between  Acorn and neighboring Cypress Village as well as Lower Bottoms occur frequently. In order to reduce the violence between the two housing projects, in 2003 local rappers from both Acorn and Cypress released an underground mixtape titled Acorn & Cypress inspired by other unity rap albums like the Bloods and Crips Bangin' on Wax releases.

The contents were off-loaded into 55-gallon drums which were stored on the lot until the chemicals were transferred into smaller containers for re-sale. An investigation by the Oakland Fire Department, Alameda County and the U.S. Coast Guard found over 100 full and empty 5- and 55-gallon drums, some of which were leaking. Subsequent to AMCO ceasing operations in 1989, the lot was used by DC Metals for scrap storage until 1998, and by Cable Moore, Inc. for cable storage until the present time.
In June 1995, a construction crew digging a trench noted a strong chemical odor in the dirt. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), DC Metals, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted an investigation which uncovered chlorinated solvents and other contaminants, including vinyl chloride, and soil gas.  Due to the presence of groundwater found during the investigation, emergency remediation processes were initiated.
The remediation efforts began with the construction of a ground water and soil vapor extraction (SVE) treatment system. Between January 1997 through July 1998, approximately 7,000 pounds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), approximately 40 pounds of which were vinyl chloride, were extracted from the soil and groundwater.  The SVE ceased operation in July 1998 due to concerns from nearby residents over exposure to fumes from the exhaust of the system. During the remediation process, additional contamination from methylene chloride, 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA), and trichloroethene (TCE) were discovered. Detailed assessments taken during the emergency remediation effort revealed that the danger to the surrounding residences was not imminent but the site would pose long-term dangers.
The site was listed on the National Priority List (Superfund) on September 29, 2003.  The detailed remediation investigation concluded in 2006. The Draft Remedial Investigation Report is being prepared but the EPA has already announced that they will excavate contaminated soil from six residences surrounding the AMCO site."

In 1905, Robert S. Moore, his brother Joseph A. Moore, and John Thomas Scott purchased the National Iron Works located in the Hunter's Point section of  San Francisco, and founded a new company, the Moore & Scott Iron Works  Moore had previously been vice president of the Risdon Iron Works.  Scott was a nephew of Henry T. Scott and Irving M. Scott, owners of the nearby Union Iron Works, where John had risen from apprentice to superintendent.  Their new business was soon destroyed by fire resulting from the San Francisco earthquake.  They quickly recovered and were back in business before the end of 1906.In 1909, Moore and Scott decided to move across the Bay, and so purchased the W.A. Boole and Son Shipyard in Oakland located at the foot of Adeline along the Oakland Estuary.
In 1917, Moore bought out Scott and changed he business name to Moore Shipbuilding Company. In 1922, the company was renamed again as Moore Dry Dock Company.  It operated primarily as a repair yard. Its shipbuilding capabilities were expanded in the World War II era, building over 100 ships for the U.S. Navy and merchant marine.  Moore ranked 82nd among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. With the end of the war, shipbuilding ceased, but repair operations continued. Moore Dry Dock Company finally closed in 1961.
The yard was notable for its employment of several thousand African Americans, in both skilled and unskilled positions, at a time when they confronted major racial discrimination on the job.
At the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park an inscription honoring the wartime contributions made by the Bay Area Shipyards during World War II states that ""Moore Dry Dock handled the difficult jobs of production, repair and conversion that slowed overall output in other yards.""
In 1950, the Moore facility was the target of a union picket when sailors were having a dispute with a ship owner whose ship was in Moore's dry dock at the time. The court battle which ensued eventually lead to the Moore Dry Dock Standards for Primary Picketing at a Secondary Site (Sailors' Union of the Pacific (Moore Dry Dock Co.), 92 NLRB 547, 27 LRRM 1108 (1950)).Moore Dry Dock Company ceased operations in 1961.

The HMB-1 was originally developed as part of Project Azorian (more widely, but erroneously, known as ""Project Jennifer""), the top-secret effort mounted by the Central Intelligence Agency to salvage the remains of the Soviet submarine K-129 from the ocean floor.
The HMB-1 was designed to allow the device that would be used to grasp and lift the submarine to be constructed inside the barge and out of sight, and to be installed in the Glomar Explorer in secrecy. This was done by towing the HMB-1, with the capture device inside, to a location near Catalina Island (off the coast of California), and then submerging it onto stabilizing piers that had been installed on the seafloor. The Glomar Explorer was then maneuvered over the HMB-1, the retractable roof was opened, and the capture device lifted into the massive ""moon pool"" of the ship, all within clear sight of people on the beach.After the conclusion of Project Azorian, the HMB-1 was mothballed at the Todd Shipyard in San Francisco, California until November 1982. At that time, the United States Navy towed the huge barge to a Lockheed Martin facility in Redwood City, California, where it became a floating drydock for the construction and sea trials of the Sea Shadow, an experimental stealth ship being tested by the Navy.

By 2005, the AIPCS students achieved test scores superior those of most public schools in the state. Its principal, Ben Chavis (Lumbee), a Native American educator, believed that minority students were best served by high expectations for strong attendance and discipline, as well as regular homework and summer school. Chavis was criticized for some of his methods. In 2007, AICPS became the first public school in Oakland to win the National Blue Ribbon Award. The AICPS attracted an increasingly diverse student body as enrollment increased, with higher proportions of African American, Asian and Latino students than Native Americans. By 2015, its students were overwhelmingly Asian.The American Indian Model Schools charter system developed from the AIPCS in order to expand the offerings to students.

493,San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge,"The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, known locally as the Bay Bridge, is a complex of bridges spanning San Francisco Bay in California. As part of Interstate 80 and the direct road between San Francisco and Oakland, it carries about 260,000 vehicles a day on its two decks. It has one of the longest spans in the United States.
The toll bridge was conceived as early as the California Gold Rush days, but construction did not begin until 1933. Designed by Charles H. Purcell, and built by American Bridge Company, it opened on Thursday, November 12, 1936, six months before the Golden Gate Bridge. It originally carried automobile traffic on its upper deck, with trucks, cars, buses and commuter trains on the lower, but after the Key System abandoned rail service, the lower deck was converted to all-road traffic as well. In 1986, the bridge was unofficially dedicated to James Rolph.The bridge has two sections of roughly equal length; the older western section, officially known as the Willie L. Brown Jr. Bridge (after former San Francisco Mayor and California State Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr.), connects downtown San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island, and the newer unnamed eastern section connects the island to Oakland. The western section is a double suspension bridge with two decks, westbound traffic being carried on the upper deck while eastbound is carried on the lower one. The largest span of the original eastern section was a cantilever bridge. During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, a portion of the eastern section's upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck and the bridge was closed for a month. Reconstruction of the eastern section of the bridge as a causeway connected to a self-anchored suspension bridge began in 2002; the new eastern section opened September 2, 2013, at a reported cost of over $6.5 billion, a 2,500% cost overrun from the original estimate of $250 million.  Unlike the western section and the original eastern section of the bridge, the new eastern section is a single deck with the eastbound and westbound lanes on each side making it the world's widest bridge, according to Guinness World Records, as of 2014. Demolition of the old east span was completed on September 8, 2018."

It was an undersea megathrust earthquake that registered a magnitude of 9.1–9.3 Mw, reaching a Mercalli intensity up to IX in certain areas. The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate.
A series of large tsunami waves grew up to 30 metres (100 ft) high once heading inland, after being created by the underwater seismic activity offshore. Communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean were seriously affected, and the tsunamis killed an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries.

531,Université d'État d'Haïti,"The Université d'État d'Haïti (UEH) (English: State University of Haiti) is one of Haiti's most prestigious institutions of higher education. It is located in Port-au-Prince.
Its origins date to the 1820s, when colleges of medicine and law were established. In 1942, the various faculties merged into the University of Haiti. After a student strike in 1960, François Duvalier's government brought the university under firm government control and renamed it the State University of Haiti. In 1983, the University became an independent institution according to the Haitian constitution. The University's independent status was confirmed in the Haitian constitution of 1987.
In 1981, there were 4,099 students at the University of Haiti, of whom 26% were enrolled in the School of Law and Economics, 25% in the School of Medicine and Pharmacy, 17% in the School of Administration and Management, and 11% in the School of Science and Topography. Despite the important role played by agriculture in the Haitian economy, only 5% of the university's students were enrolled in the School of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine. In 1981, the University of Haiti had 559 professors, compared to 207 in 1967. Most professors worked part-time, were paid on an hourly basis, and had little time for contact with students. UEH also suffered severe shortages of books and other materials.
As of 2010, tuition was US$15 a year. However, while this made it more affordable for many Haitians than other forms of tertiary education in the country, competition for places was fierce. The university accepted only 15% of applicants for undergraduate places, while its dentistry school had just 20 places for about 800 applicants yearly.

Among its past rectors, the University includes the writer, Jean Price Mars.
The university's buildings were largely destroyed during the earthquake of January 12, 2010. A consortium of historically black colleges in the United States was formed to help rebuild part of the campus.After the earthquake, the government of the Dominican Republic paid for the construction of a new university campus near the town of Limonade in northern Haiti, called the Université d'État d'Haïti, Campus Henri Christophe de Limonade."

549,Cité Soleil,"Cité Soleil (Haitian Creole: Site Solèy; English: Sun City) is an extremely impoverished and densely populated commune located in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area in Haiti. Cité Soleil originally developed as a shanty town and grew to an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 residents, the majority of whom live in extreme poverty. The area is generally regarded as one of the poorest and most dangerous areas of the Western Hemisphere and it is one of the biggest slums in the Northern Hemisphere. The area has virtually no sewers and has a poorly maintained open canal system that serves as its sewage system, few formal businesses but many local commercial activities and enterprises, sporadic but largely free electricity, a few hospitals, and two government schools, Lycee Nationale de Cite Soleil, and Ecole Nationale de Cite Soleil. For several years until 2007, the area was ruled by a number of gangs, each controlling their own sectors. But government control was reestablished after a series of operations in early 2007 by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) with the participation of the local population.
The neighborhood is located at the western end of the runway of Toussaint Louverture International Airport and adjoins the grounds of the former Hasco Haitian American sugar complex. It began with the construction in 1958 of homes for 52 families. In the summer of 1966, a mysterious fire in the slum of La Saline displaced many of its residents. 1,197 homes were built there and it was named Cité Simone, after Haiti's First Lady Simone Ovide Duvalier. In 1972, a major fire near the central market of Port-au-Prince displaced yet more people who ended up in the Boston section of Cité Simone. In 1983, the census recorded 82,191 people in Cité Simone.Originally designed to house sugar workers, Cité Simone later housed manual laborers for a local Export Processing Zone (EPZ). Neoliberal reforms beginning in the early 1970s made this place a magnet for squatters from around the countryside looking for work in the newly constructed factories. This movement accelerated in the early 1980s with the destruction of the Creole pigs by American order in response to an African swine flu outbreak, followed by the rise of Finance Minister Leslie Delatour who took this post following the ouster of Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986. Delatour openly advocated the depopulation of much of the Haitian countryside and that these people work instead in cities, living in places such as the newly named Cité Soleil, though not for Hasco that Delatour shut down in 1987.  This industrial sector was however damaged following the 1991 coup d'état that deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, causing a boycott of Haitian products that closed the EPZ. Cité Soleil continued to be plagued by extreme poverty and persistent unemployment, with high rates of illiteracy.Half of the houses of Cité Soleil are made of cement with a metal roof, half are made completely of scavenged material. An estimated 60 to 70% of houses have no access to a latrine, particularly in the marshy Brooklyn area which includes Cité Carton.Armed gangs roamed the streets and terrorized the neighborhood. Every few blocks was controlled by one of more than 30 armed factions. Though the gangs no longer rule, murder, rape, kidnapping, looting, and shootings are still common. The area has been called a ""microcosm of all the ills in Haitian society: endemic unemployment, illiteracy, non-existent public services, unsanitary conditions, widespread crime and armed violence"".After the devastating 2010 earthquake, it took nearly two weeks for relief aid to arrive in Cité-Soleil."
550,Fort Dimanche,"Fort Dimanche is a former prison in Haiti located near La Saline in Port-au-Prince that was notorious for torture and murder during the reign of François Duvalier. It was declared a monument in 1987.The original Fort Dimanche was built by the French when Haiti was a colony prior to 1804 and fell into disrepair. It became a military facility built by the US Marines in the 1920s during the American occupation of Haiti. Already prior to Duvalier it may have been used for the handling of political prisoners. During the reign of Duvalier he and his Tonton Macoutes used the facility as an interrogation center and prison to incarcerate, torture, and murder political opponents. Also people who tried to escape from the island and were caught were brought to Fort Dimanche. His son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, continued to use it as an instrument of terror.
Crammed into tiny cells, three by three by four feet, inmates slept in shifts in their own filth. Gruel as food was placed on the floor, water was given out infrequently, in addition, inmates drank some of the water when they were hosed down once a week. Dead bodies were often not removed for days and then dumped into mass graves outside the prison. Prisoners died from torture, dehydration, malnutrition, and infections. Most did not survive. It has been estimated that about 3,000 inmates died.When  Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cédras led a military coup against Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991, Fort Dimanche was turned temporarily into an armory."
